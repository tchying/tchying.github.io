#### Analysis and Video
#### Deliverables for 2021 CNSBC

As a member of the University of Waterloo's Steel Bridge Design Team, I used SAP2000 to test seven load cases on a model of a twenty foot steel bridge. I was required to determine the shear, moment, and deflection at key points along the bridge's top chord. My findings were reported in the analysis deliverable for the 2021 Canadian National Steel Bridge Competition. The team placed fifth in this section, out of twelve teams.

I also summarized the entirety of the analysis deliverable into a three-minute section of a video deliverable, again submitted as part of the 2021 CNSBC. The team placed sixth in this section.
