#### Backyard Survey

I did a partial survey of my backyard.

Obviously, I couldn't use an autolevel or a total station, so instead I used an ordinary level, a measuring tape, and pin flags.

I also taped a laser pointer to a tripod.

Flags were placed in a grid, two feet apart. Although everything else was measured using metric units, two feet was convienent as the level was exactly four feet in length. Where two feet wasn't an option, due to various obstructions in my backyard, one foot intervals were used instead.

At each point marked by a flag, the level was held upright and as vertical as possible. Only one axis could be checked due to the configuration of the bubble levels. Then, the laser pointer was oriented towards the level and the reading was recorded.
