#### About
I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm looking for a co-op position for the Fall 2021 term.

I have experience in land and construction surveying through my previous position as a student field technologist, and my involvement with the University of Waterloo Steel Bridge Design Team has given me exposure to structural analysis software and allowed me to demonstrate my skills in technical communication.

Outside of school, I enjoy [cooking](/collage.png), playing a weird variety of video games, and adding random bits of HTML/&#8203;CSS/&#8203;JS to perfectly good website templates.
