#### About
I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm seeking a co-op position for January 2021.

Outside of school and the endless job search, I enjoy cooking, playing a weird variety of video games, and adding random bits of HTML/&#8203;CSS/&#8203;JS to perfectly good website templates.
