#### About
I'm a second-year Civil Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm seeking a co-op position for January 2021.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking edible* food, playing retro and contemporary video games, and adding random bits of HTML/CSS/JS to perfectly good website templates.
