#### Total Stress Spreadsheet

As part of a project in my Earth Engineering course (CIVE 153), I created a spreadsheet that calculated the total stress at 155 points above, inside, and below an earthen embankment.

Then, this was replicated two additional times for pre-construction, post-construction, and peak flood condition, for a total of 465 points.
